## Introduction

C is a powerful programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. It is widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, and for developing high-performance software. This repository aims to provide a structured learning path, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics.

## Getting Started

If you're new to C programming, begin with the basics. You can start by exploring the following topics:

- Setting up your development environment
- Writing your first "Hello, World!" program
- Understanding variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow and decision-making with conditionals and loops

## Basic Concepts

Once you've grasped the fundamentals, dive deeper into the essential concepts of C programming:

- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and memory management
